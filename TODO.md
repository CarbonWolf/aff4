# Introduction #

Before we can have a full release of libaff4 and accompanying tools we need to do the following tasks:

  * Develop C API - Right now the best API is actually python - we need to develop a C api - perhaps even autogenerated for external programs to use.

  * Imaging tool
    * Should have a curses GUI
    * Should record lots of drive metadata
    * Plain C version should also be available

  * Encryption
    * Support all encryption modes (passphrase, cert based etc).
    * Imager should also support encryption.

  * GUI for AFF4 volumes.
    * Should develop from the PyFlag GUI
    * Should be more efficient wrt directory navigation. Build RDF relations describing directory memberships and use those instead of just scanning all items in a volume. This needs to also be applied to fuse implementation.
