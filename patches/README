These patches should be applied to sleuthkit-3.0.1 to allow support for aff4.

make sure libaff4 is installed properly first.

tar -xvzf sleuthkit-3.0.1.tar.gz 
cd sleuthkit-3.0.1
patch -p1 < sleuthkit-3.0.1.patch

## The following is needed to get the autoconf system to pick up the changes
libtoolize --force
aclocal -I config
autoheader
automake
autoconf

## Now build it as normal
./configure
make install

It is now possible to use fls etc, by specifying:
fls -i aff4 aff4_file.zip stream_name

Where stream_name is the name of the stream that contains the image
(This can be a link or a fully qualified name).
